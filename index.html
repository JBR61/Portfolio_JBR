            <h1>Josh Rush</h1>
            <h2>Computer Scientist</h2>
            <p>I am a student at the Universtiy of Pittsburgh. Apart from that I'm a person who is creative and will work hard to make visions come to fruition. I come from a small town an hour outside city limits. I've always looked at Pittsburgh as almost a paradise since I was a kid, and I would love to live and work there.</p>

                <h3>Dracula's Castle Soundscape</h3>
                <p>With this project, I was trying to convey aa world and its imagery with just sounds. I tried to make the listener feel as if they were walking through Dracula's Castle. This project was done in Audacity with sounds from freesound.org.</p>

                <h3>Saudi Cows Visual Argument</h3>
                <p>This project was made to highlight an issue that I thought needed more attention. There was an issue with water rights in Arizona, so I made this graphic for it. I used primarily gimp to put it together with images from stock photo sites. I think it portrays this issue in an effective way that could spur any internet users who came across to hopefully look deeper. </p>

                <h3>Avella Spies Save The World</h3>
                <p>This was a project made during my early years of highschool. I edited it in final cut pro, as well as wrote and directed it. In this project we had to write up a story board, as well as execute it with the props available to us and other students in the class. I chose to inclde this as I believe it showcases my creativity.</p>
