In this portfolio I went with a pretty simple design.
First at the very top I added a section that has three buttons that can take you to the other sections of the page.
After that I just wanted to have a section that would tell the reader about myself, some of my qualifications and skills.
It also tells my desires and qualities.
Under that section I just put three boxes with a picture of the projects I choose to show off.
Then it will give a brief description of it and how I created it.
Some of the projects have buttons that will take you to the video or play audio.
Finally, under that I decided to just add a small section that gives my contact info like my LinkedIn and Email so an interested employer could contact me.
I chose what include in the page by looking online at other portfolios and examples.
In the future I want to make the page look less cohesive. I feel like it pretty boring with it's current layout.
Other layouts and things I tried on this page were hard to implement and did not work well, so I went with most functional version.
I would like to add a banner photo of Pittsburgh as well.
