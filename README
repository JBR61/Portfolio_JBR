For this portfolio, I am not sure what else I can do to make it more interesting to look at.
I tried to add a banner and a picture of myself but I havn't got that worked out yet.
I also want to change the color inside of the boxes that each project is in.
Other than that, the website looks very boring and basic to me, but I do not know what else I could add.
