In this portfolio I went eith a pretty simple design. First I just wanted to have a section that would tell the reader about myself, some of my qualifications and skills. After that section is fully filled out, I may choose to move it to a different section or make new web page for it. Under that section I just put three boxes with a picture of the projects I choose to show off. Then it will give a brief description of it and how I created it. Finally a button that either makes the pager bigger or takes you to a more in depth description of the project. Finally, under that I decided to just add a small section that gives my contact info like my LinkedIn and Email so an interested employer could contact me.
